Pardus-Helper
=============

Suite of unobtrusive additional features to complement the online game Pardus and make gameplay more enjoyable, focuses specifically on improving trading.

The end-result for this program involves combining as much functionality as possible from as many different sources as possible in as efficient and unobtrusive a manner while giving the user the option to fully customize which features she wishes to use.

All code/inspiration that was taken from extensions was taken with the author's consent and will not be used verbatim, but rather as inspiration for my code.
